# AGENTS.md

## Overview
- This repository is a collection of AI agent skills, including browser agent skills and development skills.
- Skills should be organized under `atlas/` in clearly named subdirectories.

## Skill layout
- Each skill lives in its own folder under `atlas/`.
- Required: `SKILL.md` with name, description, triggers, and usage.
- Optional: `references/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/` for supporting material.

## Editing guidelines
- Keep skills focused and minimal; avoid duplicating content across skills.
- Prefer reusable scripts in `scripts/` over large inline code blocks in docs.
- Use ASCII for new files unless the content explicitly requires Unicode.

## Verification
- No default tests are defined; run any skill-specific scripts if they exist.
